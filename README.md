# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). This application contains a lot of heart and soul (and a healthy amount of tears) to make it all work. This is version 2. Enjoy!

## Dependencies

- Node.js
- Express
- EJS
- bcryptjs
- cookie-session

## Getting Started

- Install all dependencies (using the `npm install` command).

## Updated Fixes

- Functional requirements were fixed to address:
  - When a user is logged in, there's an extra 'logout' button underneath the nav bar.
  - Major: If a user is not logged in, GET /urls should return HTML with a relevant error message.
  - Major: If a user is not logged in, GET /urls/new should redirect them to /login.
  - Major: After updating a URL, the user should be redirected to GET /urls. The URL also does not update.
